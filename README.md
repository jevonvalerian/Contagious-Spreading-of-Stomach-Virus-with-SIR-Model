# Contagious-Spreading-of-Stomach-Virus-with-SIR-Model
This is the second project for me and my team as students at the Bandung Institute of Technology. We carry out simulations related to the process of spreading the virus and visualizing the status of the community using the SIR Model (Susceptible, Infectious, Recover) and Celular Automata with python programming language.
